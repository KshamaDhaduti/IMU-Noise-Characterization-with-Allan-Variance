The project focuses on characterizing and selecting IMU sensors for different robotic applications. A device driver in python script was developed for the Vectornav VN-100 IMU sensor, and data was collected and analyzed using ROS. The hardware setup involved configuring Ubuntu to address USB latency issues and make the sensor plug-and-play. Stationary noise analysis was performed by parsing the sensor data and plotting time series graphs of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. The noise characteristics of each value, such as mean and standard deviation, were determined. Furthermore, a long-duration data collection was conducted for Allan variance analysis, aiming to identify errors and noise sources present in the IMU data. The collected data was analyzed using MATLAB functions, and comparisons were made to the VN100 datasheet. The project provided insights into sensor selection, noise characterization, and performance evaluation for robotics sensing and navigation applications.
